1
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,395
Ooh, fuck. Yeah, it doesn't matter.

2
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,231
Whoa. You okay there, Richard?

3
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,191
Uh... yeah, I'm fine.

4
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,984
Sorry, I can't really throw it any slower.

5
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,319
Give it another cut, Richard.

6
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,154
No, I'm fine. I don't want to.

7
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:32,115
Maybe someone else wants to. Who's next?

8
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,868
If someone has to go, I'll go,
but it seems very frightening.

9
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,662
You sure? You got us for the whole hour.

10
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:40,123
- Anyone?
- Would it hurt your feelings if no one went?

11
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,062
Man: Ladies and gentlemen,

12
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:47,047
welcome to the annual
stern Taylor fall classic.

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,008
I 'd like to start by making a toast
to our very special guest tonight,

14
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:52,719
Richard Hendricks.

15
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:57,558
Richard, after your perfect game
at techcrunch disrupt a few weeks ago,

16
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,393
we fell in love with you and your tech.

17
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,645
Look, we know everyone
in the valley is after you,

18
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:06,233
and we know that you're probably
going to go with Peter Gregory,

19
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,860
but we'd love to have you
come play on our team.

20
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,946
Let stern Taylor capital fund in

21
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,324
on your series a financing,
because together, Richard,

22
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,867
we 'd be

23
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:19,162
a home run!

24
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,834
- Oh, right.
- What do you say, Richard?

25
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,130
I'll do what I can.

26
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,508
All right. Have fun, everybody.

27
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,512
I don't know, man.

28
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,116
It's starting to feel weird
letting all these firms suck up to us,

29
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,933
even though we're not gonna
take their money.

30
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:43,604
Richard, Peter Gregory hasn't officially
given us the term sheet yet.

31
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,772
Yes, but he will tomorrow
when he gets back.

32
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:49,776
If you can't enjoy this many people
kissing our ass at this level,

33
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,986
then I feel sorry for you.

34
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,531
Would you just relax
and take it in for a second?

35
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:58,201
I mean, we are getting our dicks sucked
at the at&t park.

36
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,706
We're standing on the field of
the world series champions.

37
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:04,791
It's totally lost on me.

38
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,543
Yeah, I don't give a shit, either.

39
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,463
Hey! I'm Nicole Stein.

40
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,423
I lead the growth team at stern Taylor.

41
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,593
- Oh. I'm dinesh.
- I'm gilfoyle.

42
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,346
I love it. So what do
you two do at pied Piper?

43
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,139
I'm the CTO.

44
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,725
Ah, he's joking. I'm the CTO.

45
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,310
Fuck you, I'm joking.

46
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,604
Okay, how could you be
the chief technology officer?

47
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:30,067
I get it. You hear the word "chief,"
and you think "Indian chief."

48
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,544
But you're the other kind of Indian.

49
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,071
Okay. One, fuck you. I'm Pakistani.

50
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,531
And two, how could you be CTO of anything?

51
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:37,895
You have to be able to organize,

52
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,552
you have to be able to delegate,
you have to be...

53
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,995
I delegate you to go get me a fucking beer

54
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,664
while I talk to Nicole.

55
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,250
George silver,
operating partner at stern Taylor.

56
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,587
So, what do you do at pied Piper?

57
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,256
He's the CTO.

58
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,428
Erlich: That's drew Houston.

59
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,931
We've been circling each other
for the last 20 minutes.

60
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,474
Ooh!

61
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,684
The winklevoss twins.

62
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,812
Look at them. They're like
two genetically enhanced Ken dolls.

63
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,730
Do you know
how much bitcoin they're worth?

64
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,774
Oh, shit, they're splitting up.

65
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,485
Cameron's the left dominant one, right?

66
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,880
- I can't tell them apart.
- I'm gonna come at him from the right side,

67
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,782
try and herd them back together
without spooking them.

68
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,325
Watch this.

69
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,369
Cameron! Cameron!

70
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,871
- Okay.
- Javeed: Well, well, well,

71
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,165
look who's the big swinging dick.

72
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:30,377
Hey, javeed, everything okay at goolybib?

73
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,838
You gotta ask them. They canned me.

74
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,798
- What?
- Yeah.

75
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,551
Our investors got spooked
by a possible down round,

76
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,594
so they shoved
an acquisition down my throat.

77
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,889
Yeah, an acquisition
of $200 million, right?

78
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,977
Yeah, they all made out.
I had a reverse vest with no triggers,

79
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,688
then I lost all my shares
when they fired me.

80
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,733
I blew my whole signing bonus
renting that house.

81
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,985
I'm looking into suing 'em.

82
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,945
Jeez.

83
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,989
Look, all I can say is,

84
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,032
don't get fucked, all right?

85
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,453
You take money from the wrong dudes,
and you'll get smoked as bad as I did.

86
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,455
Just be careful.

87
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,165
Everyone is watching you now.

88
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,834
Yeah. Totally. I know. Thanks, javeed.

89
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:15,297
No. I mean, they're watching you right now.

90
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,843
Yeah.

91
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,636
Damn it. Where is that camera?

92
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,876
Dinesh: Ican't believe
how many gifts we're getting.

93
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,236
Gilfoyle: Gifts I'm getting.
That oculus rig is addressed to the CTO.

94
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,946
Dinesh: No, I'm the CTO.

95
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,074
As your superior,
I order you to give me that oculus.

96
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,911
You can't make me do stuff.
You're not the boss of me.

97
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,746
- Actually, I am the boss of you.
- Okay.

98
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,098
Gilfoyle: Richard, tell him I'm CTO.

99
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,017
Dinesh: No, you already told that fat guy
that I'm the CTO.

100
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,709
Stop, stop, stop. Please stop.

101
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,590
I have a ton of work to do.
You have work to do.

102
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,714
Maybe let's do the work instead of that.

103
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,551
Jared, we were supposed
to get a term sheet today.

104
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,875
Have we heard from Peter Gregory?

105
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,931
Peter Gregory is dead.

106
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,724
What?

107
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,400
Holy shit.

108
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,119
Monica: He was the smartest,

109
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,997
shrewdest,

110
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,542
Strangest man I've ever known.

111
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,671
I can't believe that he's gone.

112
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,258
Can I ask what happened?

113
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,134
Yeah. Um...

114
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,054
He was in the serengeti on safari...

115
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,682
- Ah.
- And he had just gone into his tent

116
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,726
when a hippo wandered into the camp.

117
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,562
Oh, wow.

118
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,939
He was attacked by a hippo?

119
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,190
No. No.

120
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,902
I guess the hippo started to charge

121
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,446
when the guide grabbed his rifle
and shot at it,

122
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,201
but his aim was off, and...

123
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,747
And he shot Peter Gregory by accident?

124
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,292
- Yeah.
- No, he missed...

125
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,421
But I guess the sound of the gun
startled Peter,

126
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:23,008
who ran out of his tent and...

127
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,887
Ran right into the hippo?

128
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,890
No, the hippo was
also startled by the noise

129
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:34,853
and had run off prior
to Peter exiting his tent.

130
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,650
So, what happened to Peter?

131
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:45,196
He hadn't run in a long time,

132
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,993
maybe ever, and you know, hejust...

133
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,831
That was it.

134
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,841
That is so very strange.

135
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,677
- Very sad and tragic. Wow.
- Very sad and strange.

136
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,889
See you.

137
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,475
Man, that is so weird.

138
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,853
I mean, one minute Peter Gregory is here,
the next, he'sjust gone.

139
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,104
Erlich: Jared, it's erlich.

140
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,274
I need you to set up
all the other vc meetings, asap.

141
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,026
Line 'em up nuts to butts.

142
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,838
Erlich, what are you doing? Monica
just said they're still gonna fund us.

143
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,947
We should just sit tight.

144
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,951
Look, I loved Peter Gregory
maybe even more than he loved me,

145
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,345
but there's something
you need to know here,

146
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,372
something that Monica
isn't exactly volunteering up,

147
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,083
and that's that all of these one-man firms
have a key-man clause.

148
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,626
- Do you know what that means?
- No.

149
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,212
It means that now that
Peter Gregory is gone,

150
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,672
all the raviga investors

151
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,591
have the contractual right
to cash out and walk away,

152
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:50,011
which means that by the end of the day,
there may not be a raviga.

153
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,639
- Seriously?
- Yes, so we have to prepare for that.

154
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,767
Now, I know that it makes me
sound like a terrible person,

155
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,018
but we have a company to run.

156
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,372
And do you know who
the first person to agree with me would be?

157
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,730
Peter Gregory.

158
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,368
And that is the very first spot
in our new campaign

159
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,412
heralding the upcoming release of nucleus

160
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,163
this January at ces.

161
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,166
- Any questions?
- I have a question.

162
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,251
That was horrible.

163
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,505
I just got humiliated by a fucking
teenager at techcrunch disrupt,

164
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,341
and you give me this tampon ad?

165
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,427
A girl with diabetes on a swing?

166
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,429
- I think she has cancer.
- Man: Yeah.

167
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,180
At least that's how I read it.

168
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,866
I don't care what kind of disease she had!

169
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,020
All I care about is that
nucleus is better than pied Piper.

170
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,771
Hendricks just left us all in the dust.

171
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,107
If we get this wrong,

172
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,609
we could blow
the business opportunity of a lifetime!

173
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,195
Data creation is exploding.

174
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,159
With all the selfies and useless files
people refuse to delete on the cloud,

175
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:59,873
92% of the world's data
was created in the last two years alone.

176
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,041
At the current rate,

177
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:05,170
the world's data storage capacity
will be overtaken by next spring.

178
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,630
It will be nothing short of a catastrophe.

179
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:11,760
Data shortages, data rationing,
data black markets.

180
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:15,388
Someone's compression
will save the world from data-geddon,

181
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:19,100
and it sure as hell better be nucleus
and not goddamn pied Piper!

182
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,270
I don't know about you people,

183
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,673
but I don't wanna live in a world

184
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,817
where someone else makes the world
a better place better than we do.

185
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,410
"Data-geddon." is he married to that, or...

186
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,662
There's just been a
lot of "geddons" lately.

187
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,415
That's true.
"Snow-mageddon," "car-mageddon."

188
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,501
There's that movie armageddon.

189
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,674
Laurie, you wanted to see me?

190
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,861
Monica, come in, come in.
I'm sure you've heard by now

191
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,720
that I've been named
our new managing partner.

192
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,514
Monica: Yes. Congratulations.

193
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,767
Did the limited partners tell you
how they made their decision?

194
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,144
Oh. They looked at the
portfolio performances

195
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,539
of each of the senior partners
over the last several funds,

196
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,066
and my numbers were,
objectively, the most favorable.

197
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,776
Therefore, I was selected.

198
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:14,489
Yeah, it's just managing partner
is all about meeting with people

199
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,366
and interacting with people.

200
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,329
You can sit down if you want to.
Do you want to?

201
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,036
- Oh...
- Or should we stand?

202
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,955
Uh... I... whatever...

203
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,039
- I'm standing...
- Okay.

204
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,290
But you don't have to.

205
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,752
- Okay.
- Would it make you feel awkward to sit?

206
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,254
I'm okay to stand.

207
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,091
- Monica...
- Of course.

208
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,093
Peter Gregory is dead.

209
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,804
Yes, I know.

210
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:42,142
On a personal note, his death is very sad.

211
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,061
But on a professional
level, it's untenable.

212
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,345
I've been reviewing his files.

213
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,898
He was pursuing a number
of extremely dubious positions.

214
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:53,653
Are you aware that we own
a $30 million ostrich farm in Morocco,

215
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,656
or that we are the majority stakeholders

216
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,409
in three companies that
specialize in invisibility?

217
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:04,289
This box is filled with napkins covered
with notes detailing Peter's conviction

218
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:08,293
that genetically-modified cranberry fungus
would become the next cotton.

219
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,420
- That... that one I remember.
- Yes.

220
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:12,964
- Monica.
- Mmm-hmm.

221
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,550
Peter Gregory is dead.

222
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,511
- Yes.
- We need to seem competitive,

223
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,013
now more than ever,

224
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,266
to our investors as well
as to the industry at large.

225
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,350
Well, I mean,

226
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:28,396
pied Piper is probably the hottest
early investment in town right now,

227
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,731
and we have them.

228
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,441
Do we?

229
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,570
But why then are they speaking to other
firms about investing in their series a?

230
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,448
No, no. I just told them
to sit tight for a day or two

231
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,741
until we sorted things out.

232
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:44,037
It seems that that advanced
a sense of uncertainty,

233
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,331
and now we're at risk
of losing their round.

234
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,833
This could jeopardize the firm

235
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,878
and, by extension, your
career here, Monica,

236
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,421
as an associate partner.

237
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,216
Well, I guess I was just kind of in shock.

238
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,342
Monica...

239
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,305
Peter Gregory is dead.

240
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,185
Yes. I know.

241
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,188
Erlich: This is great.

242
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,732
I mean, do you know how many times
I've gone into these rooms

243
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,777
with nothing but a half
of an ass in my hand?

244
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,657
We're walking in there with 3-foot cocks
covered in Elvis dust.

245
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,494
- Really?
- Richard Hendricks? They're ready for you.

246
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,956
- This is a fucking layup, guys.
- Richard: Okay, let's do this.

247
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,125
Erlich: Not you, Jared.

248
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,753
Now, with proper funding,

249
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:38,591
we should be able to put together
a functioning beta in time for ces

250
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:43,054
and compress nucleus
out of the marketplace.

251
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,809
Yeah.

252
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,935
I don't know.

253
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,437
You don't... what?

254
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,023
It just doesn't seem worked out to me.

255
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:59,362
Well, I mean, it was worked out enough
to win techcrunch disrupt.

256
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,282
Yes, and congratulations, you won 50 grand,

257
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,785
but you're asking us for 200 times that.

258
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:10,665
Richard, look, we all know
about your amazing compression rate,

259
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,875
but let's not be naive here.

260
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,045
You can't expect to just
throw money at an algorithm

261
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,966
and beat one of the largest
tech companies in the world.

262
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,676
So why don't you rework this a little

263
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,470
and come back in with a little more?

264
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,180
Maybe next week?

265
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,183
And?

266
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,686
That was really weird.

267
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,731
I guess we don't have
as much Elvis dust on us as I thought.

268
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,483
You see? This is why I
wanted to go with Peter Gregory.

269
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:38,609
This is bullshit.

270
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:42,322
I mean, that guy throws this huge party for
us and then acts like he doesn't even want us?

271
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,906
I mean, I fucking hate parties.

272
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,926
And then he says, "come back next week
when you have more."

273
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,661
More? More than 5.2 on weissman?

274
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,455
No. No.

275
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,708
Fuck that guy. Fuck this place.
Fuck this whole place.

276
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,336
- Watch me fuck this place.
- No, wait! Wait, wait!

277
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,341
Hey. You remember when you told me
to come back when I had more?

278
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,009
And then I said I would?

279
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,679
Well, I'm not going to. Ever.
This doesn't count. Okay.

280
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,349
I'm covered in dust. I'm a 3-foot dick,

281
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,976
and I've got half an ass
to go to some other company

282
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,021
who's never gonna put me on a jumbotron
or throw balls at me.

283
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,776
Bye.

284
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,869
Are you feeling unwell?
Do you need protein?

285
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,329
I don't know what happened.

286
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,665
Between Peter dying
and raviga maybe being gone, I just...

287
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,751
I just wanna get funded
and build pied Piper.

288
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,211
I hate this part.

289
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,939
Erlich: Well, if one thing is for sure...

290
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,217
If we're gonna get any traction,
I need to step up my game.

291
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,010
It's an email from Ron laflamme.

292
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,722
"Just got a term sheet from stern Taylor.

293
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:53,976
"They offered $5 million
at $25 million post-money valuation.

294
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,311
"More than I thought."

295
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,896
Shit. They were negging us.

296
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,940
- Negging?
- Negging is going negative.

297
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,443
It's a manipulative sex strategy
used by lonely chauvinists.

298
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:03,796
Erlich: See, everybody wants us.

299
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,074
But, by shitting all over us,
they try and bring our price down.

300
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:12,078
But you shitting all over them
counteracted their shitting all over us.

301
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,415
You negged a neg.
Richard, this could be good.

302
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,834
- Where do we have next?
- Ross loma capital.

303
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,478
Should I keep doing it?
Should I keep negging?

304
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,962
No, no, I'll handle this.

305
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,673
If they want to negotiate
using hostility and rudeness,

306
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,676
well, they picked the wrong guy.

307
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,304
Well, you see, our main concern

308
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,683
is how you're going to achieve
escape velocity on your growth rate.

309
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,351
If critical mass...

310
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,980
I'm sorry. What's funny?

311
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,232
It's just that painting behind you.

312
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,025
It's awful.

313
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,779
It looks like harlequin kama-sutra
done poorly.

314
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,782
So, I agree,

315
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,701
bad culture fit.

316
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,619
I think we all just move on.

317
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,180
Look, I didn't say
anything about a culture fit.

318
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,706
No, I did.

319
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,959
Okay. Well,

320
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,335
thank you for meeting with us.

321
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,296
We have a bunch of these things to go to,

322
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,090
hopefully with more tasteful artwork.

323
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:09,635
And your logo looks like a sideways vagina.

324
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,263
I find that to be racist, don't you?

325
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,976
Okay, here's my concern...

326
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,813
Here's my concern.
Who the hell picked out that shirt for you?

327
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,023
What?

328
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,318
Oh, I see. With the pants.

329
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,070
So I guess it's a whole thing.

330
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,739
My wife picked these out.

331
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,157
Then you married poorly.

332
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:34,327
Do you care about pied Piper?

333
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,288
Do I care about pied
Piper? Well, of course.

334
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,665
Cause if you do, I'm not seeing it.

335
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:44,629
In fact, what I think I'm seeing
is the human equivalent of a flaccid penis.

336
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,382
"Flak-sid." it's actually
pronounced "flak-sid."

337
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,884
Not a lot of people know that.

338
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,761
Well, we are definitely interested,

339
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,347
but I think we need to...

340
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,557
I'm sorry. Is something wrong?

341
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,519
No, this is all wrong.

342
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,896
I am sensing a general lack of vision.

343
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,690
Your muffins smell like shit.

344
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,442
So do your ideas.

345
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,029
One of you is the least attractive person
I've ever seen,

346
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,989
and I'm not gonna say who.

347
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,868
Should we leave or should you?

348
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:19,330
We just got offered eight at 40.

349
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,957
We're five for five, gentlemen.

350
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,626
And galveston capital fund
and yountville ventures called.

351
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,938
They want to move their meetings up
before everyone else.

352
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,714
Hey, let me try.
I want to be rude at this next one.

353
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,049
Go for it.

354
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,384
So, with some proper funding,

355
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,178
we should be able to get
a functioning beta in time for ces.

356
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,515
And if you don't fund us,

357
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,725
you're a fucking slut.

358
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,146
Oh...

359
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,774
What's that smell? Is that a fart?

360
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,985
Are you a farter?

361
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:54,031
Now, can I have a pastry?
Or are you guys gonna eat 'em all?

362
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,326
'Cause you're gonna get fat.

363
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:03,958
It's not your fault, Richard. This is
just something that can't be taught,

364
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,545
so leave the next one to me.
I can feel a big one coming on.

365
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,629
What are you gonna do?

366
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,340
I'm not sure yet, but give me room.

367
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,968
There's something inside of me
that has to come out,

368
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,553
and who am I to stop it?

369
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,140
His balls?

370
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,392
He put his balls on the table?

371
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,603
- Right on the table.
- On purpose?

372
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,188
I don't see how it could be by accident.

373
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,442
Richard, I just got an email
from the guys at midland-oak.

374
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,861
Apparently, there is a
line, and I crossed it...

375
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,782
The line between $12 and $15 million!

376
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,242
Ba-bam!

377
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,952
Midland-oak's offerjust came in.

378
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:44,457
Gentlemen, we are valued at 75 million,
fully diluted.

379
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,708
Are you shitting me?

380
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,418
Take a look at these term sheets.

381
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,587
There is a linear correlation

382
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,339
between how intolerable I was...

383
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,142
And the height of valuation.

384
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,052
Hey, you guys. Um...

385
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,138
This is Laurie bream,
the new managing partner at raviga.

386
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,475
Oh, uh... hi. I'm Richard Hendricks.

387
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,394
Yes. I recognize you from your photograph.

388
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,522
- It's very nice to meet you in person.
- Yeah.

389
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,690
Okay, so we did that.

390
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,026
Gentlemen, I am aware
of the degree of interest

391
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,295
you are receiving from other firms.

392
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,448
I am aware that participation in your series
a will require a very competitive offer,

393
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,451
but for numerous reasons,
I believe it to be the prudent decision.

394
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:25,122
Now I am presenting you with this.

395
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:29,794
$20 million at $100 million valuation?

396
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,671
I don't... uh...

397
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,340
This is way more than any other offer.

398
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,508
Correct.

399
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,010
That is very much intentional.

400
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:41,180
So, I believe that satisfies
your requirements?

401
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,683
Monica will arrange a time
to formalize the details.

402
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,309
Thank you. Have a good day.

403
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,395
Uh, thank you.

404
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:49,939
Yes.

405
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,778
Congratulations, guys. I am so glad...

406
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,657
Oh, shit! She's my ride home.
I'll call you, Richard.

407
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,200
Uh, yeah, okay.

408
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,328
- Thanks for stopping...
- Monica: Wait! Laurie, hold on!

409
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,124
Guys, I think we're funded.

410
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,543
- Yes! Richie!
- Yeah!

411
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,693
Erlich: So, I push my dick to the side,
unbutton the bottom two buttons and...

412
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,718
Bam!

413
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,429
Ah!

414
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,472
- What are you doing?
- Shit. Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

415
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,851
Meet me on the side of the house.

416
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,894
- I... okay.
- Okay. Okay. Go.

417
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,231
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

418
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,735
If anyone finds out that I came back here,
I will get fired, okay?

419
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,486
Okay.

420
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,406
- Don't take this deal.
- What?

421
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,033
You are worth half that at best.

422
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,578
Oh, wow. Thanks for the compliment.

423
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,122
No. The credit to you guys.
You negotiated your asses off,

424
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,541
but this is a classic runaway valuation.

425
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,043
What's wrong with that?

426
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:58,215
Pied Piper will be tied to this crazy valuation
that you will never be able to live up to.

427
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:02,136
If you don't keep increasing
in value in the next round,

428
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,513
if you have a down round, you are fucked.

429
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,600
It is the kiss of death for a young ceo.

430
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:11,353
You want to start with a realistic
valuation and grow at a reasonable pace.

431
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:15,941
Okay, well, if it's such a shitty deal,
then why did your boss offer it to us?

432
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,068
Because she's competitive as hell.

433
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,946
She needs pied Piper
to keep raviga afloat, Richard.

434
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,698
- Okay.
- Look, I respect Laurie,

435
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,785
but this is the exact type of thing
Peter never did.

436
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,121
Richard, come on. I
own shares in pied Piper.

437
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,290
If this high evaluation
was good in the long-term,

438
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,250
would I be standing here, risking my job?

439
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,544
Don't take our offer.

440
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,005
Maybe go with the lowest offer you got.

441
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,799
Even that might be too high.

442
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,802
Again,
thank you for the compliment.

443
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:47,932
Also, I didn't see anything in there.

444
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,017
No. Yeah, thank you.

445
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,500
I was gonna say if you had,
you'd have to show me yours, too.

446
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,774
Um...

447
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,902
- Okay.
- Okay. Thanks for the...

448
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:00,986
Okay.

449
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,378
Yeah, sorry about that party.

450
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,964
I was in kind of a bad way that night.

451
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:23,425
And truth is, I'm actually doing okay.

452
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,178
- Good. That's great.
- Yeah.

453
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,139
I mean, I could run the scenarios
about what happened all I want,

454
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,477
But I finallyjust realized
there'sjust nothing I can do, you know?

455
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:34,854
Yeah.

456
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,690
So, I'm at peace with it all.

457
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,067
I was thinking, actually, um,

458
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,778
what if you had asked for less?

459
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:45,281
What?

460
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,449
Well, what if you could've gone to someone

461
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,119
and asked for less than
what they offered that first round?

462
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,580
Like, you mean, negotiating them down?

463
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,040
- Yeah.
- Can you even do that?

464
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,085
- Well, yeah. I mean, why not?
- Yeah, but...

465
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:03,215
I mean, I guess, technically, I could have.

466
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,300
Mmm...

467
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,634
Huh.

468
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:09,471
Yeah, I suppose you could argue
that it might've been easier

469
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:13,267
to hit more realistic benchmarks

470
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,882
and reach cash flow break-even.

471
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,270
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

472
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:21,775
And then,
We wouldn't have faced that down round.

473
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:24,987
And...

474
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,824
We wouldn't have
had to settle for acquisition.

475
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,744
All that money

476
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:33,746
fucked me.

477
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,873
Wow. I mean, I don't know about...

478
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,583
- Shit!
- Maybe.

479
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,712
- Look... hey...
- No, no, no. We could've done a legit series b.

480
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,422
Right? I'd still be ceo.

481
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,008
I'd have my job,

482
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,426
my kick-ass house.

483
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,637
I'd probably still have my girlfriend...

484
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,558
- Fuck!
- Okay.

485
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:57,686
Why the fuck didn't anyone tell me
I could take less?

486
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,855
I don't know. I don't know.

487
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,107
Ideas come up and then...

488
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,609
Fuck!

489
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,195
I'll take a cab, so I'll leave you to it.

490
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,529
Thanks for meeting me here.

491
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,156
Fuck!

492
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,790
Richard.

493
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,710
Richard, I'm Laurie bream.
I was inside your home yesterday.

494
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,712
Have you made a decision
regarding our proposal?

495
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:29,051
Yeah, yeah, we'll go with you guys,
but we need to renegotiate the terms.

496
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,179
I'm afraid that's untenable.
We're offering as much money as we can.

497
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,432
Uh, no, no, we wanna go lower.
We want less... a lot less, actually.

498
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:37,392
We'll go with raviga

499
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:41,271
if you guys do $10 million
at a $50 million valuation,

500
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:42,773
not 20 at 100.

501
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,858
I think this is more reasonable,

502
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:48,696
and it's my final offer.
Take it or leave it.

503
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:49,989
I was not anticipating this,

504
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,908
but I think it will be
workable from our end.

505
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,830
And one more thing,
Monica votes for raviga's board seat.

506
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,500
Certainly that seems unimportant.

507
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,447
I will telephone your lawyer tomorrow, and
we can speak about the relevant details.

508
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,714
Good.

509
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:19,059
Peter was one of the few
who genuinely took action

510
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:22,187
to use technology to help humanity thrive.

511
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,189
But how exactly can we quantify

512
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,775
another human's contributions to mankind?

513
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,738
Let's break it down into
its three component elements.

514
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:40,748
I met Peter when he was thinking about
investing in my company, zettasphere,

515
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,458
although I think he was hesitant

516
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,502
after his disappointing
initial return from Snapchat.

517
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:50,007
He came on board, anyway,
and every month we would meet.

518
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,967
Peter was always an honest man,

519
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,720
and I know that
if Peter were here with us today,

520
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,139
he would say that
he was not disappointed in Snapchat.

521
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:01,185
And he would forgive you, lev,
for your misunderstanding.

522
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,520
That's just the kind of guy that Peter was,

523
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:06,065
warm, generous,

524
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:09,026
and not disappointed in Snapchat.

525
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,161
I'll never forget the
first time I met Peter.

526
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,498
It was in his mom's garage, where
we started our first business together

527
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,584
manufacturing vga graphics cards
for IBM clones.

528
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,003
We never looked back.

529
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,797
And you know, the last time I saw him,

530
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,175
it was at a restaurant,
not a half-mile away from that same garage.

531
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,802
We talked, as old friends do,

532
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,513
he asked me about Jackson hole,

533
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,682
I asked him about pilates.

534
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,852
And yet, something was wrong.

535
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,857
Underneath it all,
there was an unmistakable tension.

536
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,527
A tension I will forever regret.

537
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,488
It's no secret Peter and
I had our differences.

538
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,282
We let business get between us.

539
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,076
Now?

540
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,453
Now I wish I could say I'm sorry for that.

541
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,705
Now it's too late. He's gone.

542
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:08,085
And it makes me realize
the importance of forgiveness,

543
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,672
of doing things with love
and compassion in your heart,

544
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,882
and not vengeance and competition.

545
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,303
I mean, we owe that
to each other, don't we?

546
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,429
And to him?

547
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:23,475
After all, this valley is the place
Peter himself helped build.

548
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,854
Where we come together as dreamers,

549
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,230
all of us,

550
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,024
to truly make the world a better place.

551
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,320
This is Florence during the renaissance.

552
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,989
This is Camelot.

553
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:41,702
This is the place Peter himself called
"the cradle of innovation."

554
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,416
I will miss my friend.

555
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,837
Bye, Pete.

556
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,967
Maybe he is a human, after all.

557
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,264
I'm sorry.

558
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,141
It's from Ron laflamme.

559
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,311
"Gavin belson is suing you.

560
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,771
"Filed claims today that
you stole pied Piper from hooli."

561
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:11,815
Shit.

562
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,241
Gavin belson is suing us.
