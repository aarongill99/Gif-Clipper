# Gif-Clipper

The idea for the project is to be able to generate new gifs based on a saying or a phrase using movies and subtitle files

1. Text scraper that scrapes text from subtitle files
2. Save all of the matches of text with their times and movie/show names
3. Create a list of a the movies and times (could sort by IMBD rating to get top 10 or 20)
4. Select movies and times from list and cut the clip from the time segment
5. Convert the segment into a gif (Would be more efficient if combined with step 4)
6. overlay the original text onto the gif's
7. Sort and display options
